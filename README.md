# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
## **Description**
Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering, identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. They divide customers into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so they can market to each group  effectively.

There are some analytics techniques that can help you with segmenting your customers. These are useful especially when you have a large number of customers and it’s hard to discover patterns in your customer data just by looking at transactions. The two most common ones are:

**1) Clustering:**

Clustering is an exploration technique for datasets where relationships between different observations may be too hard to spot with the eye.

**2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

PCA is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

## **Features:**

1. Visualizing the gender and age distributions.
2. Analyzing their annual incomes and spending scores.
3. Using K-Means clustering algorithm to identify customer's segments.
